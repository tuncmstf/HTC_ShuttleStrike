# 🏸 HTC-Shuttle Strike

**HTC Shuttle Strike** is a personal 2D platformer game project where I combined **AI-generated pixel art** with manual edits to bring unique characters to life.  
In this project, I transformed my girlfriend into a **pixel-art game character** using **ChatGPT (AI image generation)** and **Paint** to create various poses and animations.
